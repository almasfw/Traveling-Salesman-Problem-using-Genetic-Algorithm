# Traveling-Salesman-Problem-using-Genetic-Algorithm
I was helping a friend (he wasn't pursuing computer science or another IT degree, so he needs help) with his task that is to make a program solving Traveling Salesman Problem using Genetic Algorithm.</br>

I didn't know anything about genetic algorithm at all, so I read a lot the material file from his lecturer (which is also in this repo) and this source:</br>
